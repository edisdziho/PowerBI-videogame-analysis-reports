# PowerBI-videogame-analysis-reports
Global video game sales analyzed in Power BI. Dataset cleaned, transformed, and visualized to explore sales trends, regional differences, top titles, and publisher impact."

## Project overview
This project analyzes global video game sales using **Power BI**. The goal is to transform raw sales data into interactive visualizations to support data-driven business decisions.

## Dataset
The analysis uses a real-world .csv dataset containing yearly sales data across multiple regions. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, a popular platform for sharing data science resources.
Key preprocessing steps included:
Assigning correct data types → Ensured each column (numeric, text, year, etc.) had the appropriate type for accurate processing and visualization.
Unpivoting regional sales columns → Converted regional columns into rows, creating two key fields: Region and Sales, making the dataset more flexible for filtering and analysis.
Handling missing values → Filled gaps in the Year column to maintain a complete and consistent time series.
Removing redundant columns → Dropped the Global Sales column since it represents the sum of all regions, which can be easily reconstructed within Power BI through measures and aggregations.

## Key dashboard visualizations
- **Trend chart:** Annual sales from 1980 to 2015  
- **Scatter plot:** Correlation of sales between North America and Europe  
- **Bar charts:** Top 10 best-selling games and total sales per publisher  
- **Pie chart:** Regional sales distribution  
- **Card visualization:** Best-selling platform globally  
- **Matrix visualization:** Number of games released per platform and genre  

## Usage
1. Open Power BI Desktop  
2. Load the provided `.pbix` file or `.csv` dataset  
3. Explore the dashboard and interact with filters for platform, publisher, genre, or region
